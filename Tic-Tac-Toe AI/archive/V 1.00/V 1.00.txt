This is the first viable AI version I was able to develop. Before this, I used all the data
from 2 random players making random moves on the Tic-tac-toe board. I learned that this
caused there to be too much noise in the data and the AI was not able to single out a single
move as the right one. Instead for this AI, I only used the data from the final move before
one of the random players won. From there the AI was able to predict a winning position and 
make a move that would allow it to win. The problem right now is that it is not able to predict
when an opponent can make a move that will cause it to lose. That will be the next step for now.
